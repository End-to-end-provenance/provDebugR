Description: provDebugR uses provenance post-execution to help the user understand
    and debug their script by providing functions to look at intermediate steps and
    data values, as well as their forwards and backwards lineage. provDebugR uses
    provenance produced by rdtLite (available on CRAN), stored in PROV-JSON format.
